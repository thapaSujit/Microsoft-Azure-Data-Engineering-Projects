# Create an analytical store enabled container

**Note**
In this reading you can see the steps involved in the process of creating an analytical store enabled container.

Before we can query our data using Azure Synapse Analytics using Azure Synapse Link, we must first create the container that is going to hold our data, at the same time enabling it to have an analytical store.

**Note**
Today, enabling analytical store is only available at the time of creating a container and cannot be completely disabled without deleting the container. Setting the default analytical store TTL value to 0 or null effectively disables the analytical store by no longer synchronizing new items to it from the transactional store and deleting items already synchronized from the analytical store.

**Create a new Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API container**
To create a new Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API container with analytical store enabled, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Azure portal (
https://portal.azure.com
) and select the Azure Cosmos DB account.

2. Navigate to your previously created Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API account

3. Select Data Explorer on the left-hand menu (3).

4. Click the New Container button at the top of screen.

5. Enter the new databases and container information: a. For the Database ID we choose to use AdventureWorks (5) b. Ensure that you unselect the Provision database throughput checkbox (6) c. For the container ID we choose Sales d. Enter /customerID for the Partition Key (8)

6. Choose the throughput for your container by selecting Autoscale and specify a Max RU/s of 4000 (9)

7. Scroll down and enable analytical store by ensuring that the Analytical store on radio button is selected (A)

8. Click OK to create the container.

Whilst this module assumes you understand how to appropriately configure an Azure Cosmos DB container to maximize performance and minimize cost let's briefly go over some of the thinking used to choose the values we did:

    -   We chose a partition key property of customerID as this attribute is used in many of the queries used to retrieve customer and sales order information in our application, it has relatively high cardinality (number of unique values) and thus will allow our container to scale as the number of customers and sales orders grows.

    -   We chose to use autoscale provisioned throughput and set the maximum value to 4000 RU/s as we are just starting with our application and donâ€™t expect massive query volumes initially. A max value 4000 RU/s will enable the container to automatically scale between this value all the way down to 10% of this max value (400 RU/s) when not needed. This should be plenty of throughput for what we are going to do today.

**Load sample data into the Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API container**
Perform the following steps to load a couple of sample items into the newly created container:

1. Navigate to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select the Azure Cosmos DB account.

2. Navigate to your previously created Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API account

3. Select Data Explorer in the left-hand menu (3)

4. Navigate to the items folder with the Sale container we just created by: a. Expanding AventureWorks database (4) b. Expanding the Sale Container (5) c. Clicking on the Items folder (6)

You will see no item listed in the items list (7); the container is empty.

5. Now create a new customer profile item by: a. Clicking the New Item button on the top ribbon (7) b. Enter customer profile JSON in the edit pane (8) c. Click the Save button on the ribbon (9) to save the item.

You will now see a new row in the items list (A), and if you click on this row in the items list, an updated version of the item will appear in the items pane, that includes some additional item meta data that the service automatically adds and maintains within the item body, when an item is added or updated (B)

6. Now create a new sales order item for our previously added customer by: a. Clicking the New Item button on the top ribbon (C) b. Copy the customer sales order JSON from below and past it in the edit pane (D) c. Click the Same button on the ribbon (9) to save the item.

You will now see a second document in the Items list (E)

7. Let's run a quick query against this data to retrieve customer profile and sales order information for a specific customer, this is typical of the queries our application runs: a. Click the New SQL Query icon (F) b. Enter the query into the query window (G) c. Click the Execute button (H)

You will see the results immediately returned in the results pane, including the content of both items we previously created (I)
